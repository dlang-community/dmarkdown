### Introduction


DMarkdown is an open source [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to HTML processor for the [D programming language](https://dlang.org).
It provides a simple, minimal API to generate HTML from markdown strings or ranges.

DMarkdown code was originally written as a part of the [vibe.d](https://vibed.org/) project and its API (and most of its implementation) is identical to the `vibe.textfilter.markdown` module from vibe.d .
